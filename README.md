# User Guide

## Setup 
- Check [**Docker Compose Installation**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more information about docker-compose installation.
- Verify the installation by running:
```
$ docker-compose --version
```
- If you encounter any permission issues with Docker, please refer to the [**Post-Installation Step**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to learn how to manage Docker as a non-root user.

## Build and Run API server with docker-compose
- Write the following code into the docker-compose.yaml file.
```
version: "3.9"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=root
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root
      - POSTGRES_DB=senao
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    networks: 
      - senao-network
  api:
    image: amboseqiu/senao_hw
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    command: [ "/app/main" ]
    networks: 
      - senao-network
networks:
  senao-network:
    name: senao-network
```

- To build the Docker Compose file, make sure you are in the same directory as the file.
```
$ docker-compose build
```

- Run the docker-compose 
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
- Check docker to ensure that both the API server and PostgreSQL are running. If you see something similar to the following, it means everything is working well.
```
$ docker ps -a        
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

b8f1d75b6685   postgres:14-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   7 seconds ago   Up 6 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   senao_hw-postgres-1
```
